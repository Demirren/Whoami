Greetings,

My name is Ahmet Eren and I am working as a cybersecurity engineer. Currently I am in the automotive industry. However, I am always be part of the attacking side of cybersecurity. So, when I find an oppurtunity(working or outside), always study and search about the latest news about cybersecurity and vulnerabilities. Web application penetration testing became a life standart for me. What is this and how is this system works is the perspective of my life. This is the way that I enjoy in my life. 

Cybersecurity has been expanding and evolving with greater complexity every day. AI become a part of our lives and one of my goal is to improve myself in LLM and create my own assistant. 

I'll keep updating and improving my GitHub page. Make sure to follow!
